# ECON 323 Final Project
Welcome to my final project for ECON 323 for the Fall 2020 term. My project is a UFC fight summary dashboard that presents fight and fighter statistics for UFC fights between 2010 and 2020. However, due to the fact that the UFC does not provide statistics for certain fights for a variety of reasons, including if it was the fighters first fight in the UFC, only 2700 fights are searchable.

## Data Sources
The data for this project was created from the merging of four data sources.
